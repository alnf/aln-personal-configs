## BT dongle

Adapter Erston Bluetooth 5.0, drivers are in the repository. Nothing special for installation (check readme after unpacking archive), however, to make it work I had to hard poweroff the computer (it has smth to do with electrict currents/motherboard or smth like that).

## [AsusCtl](https://gitlab.com/asus-linux/asusctl)

For switching graphics and other things. Also, to make different modes work (and external monitor via DisplayPort-Type-C cable) you would need [NVidia drivers](https://linuxconfig.org/how-to-install-the-nvidia-drivers-on-ubuntu-20-10-groovy-gorilla-linux).
